My current work at Walmart spans the entire accessibility ecosystem: from strategic leadership and architectural decisions to hands-on implementation and cultural transformation. I've built systems that scale across thousands of developers and billions of users.

I bring executive-level accessibility perspective combined with practical engineering experience—a unique combination that helps organizations embed accessibility into their DNA rather than treating it as a surface-level concern.

Remote or hybrid roles welcome (SF Bay Area available for hybrid). I'm interested in meaningful conversations about building truly inclusive digital products.`

    content: `Airbnb's mission of creating a world where anyone can belong anywhere resonates deeply with my work in accessibility. I see tremendous opportunity to extend this mission to the disability community—over 1 billion people globally.

At Walmart, I've built accessibility systems at massive scale, but I'm drawn to Airbnb's unique position connecting physical and digital experiences. Ensuring accessibility across this ecosystem presents exciting challenges I'm uniquely qualified to address.

I would bring to Airbnb both strategic leadership and hands-on implementation expertise—helping embed accessibility into products, teams, and company culture in ways that enhance the experience for all users.

I'm particularly interested in how accessibility at Airbnb can create belonging not just for guests but also enable more hosts with disabilities to participate in the community.`
